# Data Gathering Scripts

This directory contains all scripts used for gathering SCION data. Not all scripts included here were used during the measurement period of the provided dataset, as some were deemed not directly relevant. However, they may be valuable for other research purposes and are therefore included.

## General Usage

The execution and output handling of these scripts is managed by the cronjob script located in the `Scripts` directory. Direct manual use of the Python scripts in this directory is not required, though it is possible. For example, they can be run manually after the initial setup to verify functionality, or during development when testing modifications.  
During a measurement campaign, no direct interaction with this directory is necessary.
